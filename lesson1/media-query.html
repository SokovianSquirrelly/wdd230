        <h2>Alma 7:11-13</h2>
        <p>
          And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations
          of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith
          he will take upon himself the pains and the sicknesses of his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death
          which bind his people; and he will take upon him tehir infirmities,
          that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that
          he may know how to succor his people according to their infirmities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God
          suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins
          of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according
          to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony
          which is in me.

        <h2>John 3:16</h2>
        <p>
          For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
          whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
          life.
